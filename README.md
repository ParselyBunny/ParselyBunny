# Meet Parsely

Hi! I'm Parsely, a non-binary indie game developer.

Here you'll find my personal game projects, so you'll find I'm mostly making commits here and not contributions to open-source projects. You can find public repositories for some of the finished games on my [website](https://parsely-bunny.neocities.org/) if you're curious about how they're constructed, as well as a mountain of unfinished and learning projects.
