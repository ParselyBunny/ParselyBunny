# Meet Parsely

Hi! I'm a non-binary, queer, neurodivergent game developer. Pronouns: they/them, she/her.

I currently contribute to several game projects:
## [An Outcry](https://quinnk.itch.io/outcry)
A surreal, horror RPG with branching paths by GlasStadtGames.

**Role**: Event scripting

## World of Friends
A cute, 2.5d RPG with paper doll style animation developed in Unity 3D and inspired by Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.

**Role**: Unity developer
